					<p>Hey there! my name is David A. Rushing and I'm currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Development Bootcamp at UNC-Charlotte. This website - much like a career in development, I'm told - will be in a constant state of "under construction" as I learn and develop (no pun!) my skills.</p>
					<p>At 29 years old, one might ask, "Why web development, and why now?" For me, the answer is simple, but a little long at the same time. Web development has always been on my list of skills to learn, but with work and life I could never find an opportunity that fit my lifestyle, until now. Thankfully, I was accepted into the Coding Bootcamp.</p>
					<p>The journey has only begun, and I have a long way to go (read: LONG), but I've never been more excited to be frustrated. Oh, yes - frustration has been the name of the game up until this point, but I'm patient, and I know the perserverance and hunger will pay dividends in the long run. Speaking to friends I have who are web devs and just listening to the instructors, I understand this (coding) needs to become my new lifestyle. I've never read or heard of a great web developer who only practiced his or her craft "part-time." So while this is one of my 'early' projects, it's definitely an accomplishment and I can't wait to learn more skills as I go along.</p>
					<p>So, take a look around - as I mentioned above, I'm certain this page will transfrom more then a few times over the next six months and beyond - so feel free to visit every once in awhile and see what I've learned. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
